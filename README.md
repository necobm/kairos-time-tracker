# Kairos Time Report Feature

This is a Chrome Extension to enable time tracked report into Kairos HR web application, since this app doesn't have this feature natively.




## Installation

Since this extension is not already published in Chrome Web Store, you'll have to install it locally as "Developer Mode", fallowing these steps:

1- Download this source code into any directory in your local machine.

2- Fallow the instructions on this page: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked 

3- Once you had the extension installed and enabled, you should see the time report on the top of the time entries table in Kairos web app, once you have reloaded it.
